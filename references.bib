	abstract = {Nanoscale area metatronic analog circuitry utilizes relative permittivity between ma-terial interfaces to confine and direct electric displacement field and electric displacement current density operating at f = 193 THz. This is interesting because we have shown that we can map an analog finite difference algorithm into metatronics, while avoiding the partial differential equation (PDE) decreasing accuracy at increasing node density issue encountered by microscale area photonic analog circuitry also operating at f = 193 THz. The microscale area electronic analog circuitry, operating at f ≈ 300 GHz, and the nanoscale area metatronic circuitry both exhibit partial differential equation (PDE) solution increasing accuracy at increasing node density, in the same fashion to a software driven digital hardware based finite difference algorithm PDE solution approaching the accuracy of analytically derived pde solution through increased node density. With the proper allocation of hardware source and sample location for the metatronic and electronic circuitry we have shown that both analog hardwares can operate in constant time 0(1), and thus merit integration into larger software based parallel multi grid methods. However, the larger metatronic operating frequency increases its Shannon–Hartley theorem limited repetition rate (clock speed) into the Terahertz, while the smaller electronic operat-ing frequency relegates its Shannon–Hartley theorem limited repetition rate (clock speed) to the Gigahertz. Through the use of resistors, capacitors, and inductors the electronic circuit can be reconfigured to solve Laplace, Poisson, diffusion, and wave partial differential equations. In principal the metatronic circuit can bias its epsilon near zero material to induce changes in its relative permittivity inducing metatronic capacitance and inductance. Although this has not been shown in simulation at this point. Metatronic resistance occurs when the imaginary components of the epsilon near zeros material is not equal to zero. It is difficult to understand all of the constraints one must account for in hardware design if one does not fully understand the final application the hardware solves. Any PDE solution method that employs a mesh or grid, and ultimately a finite difference, in the process of generating a solution suffers from discretization error. The only method that does not are analytically derived solutions, which is why it is important to understand what makes analytical methods challenging and not widely used, because in theory, the PDE solutions they produce will be the most accurate.
The mapping of a digital finite difference algorithm to an analog circuit requires the operational frequency and corresponding wavelengths size to exceed the diameter of the analog grid. This relationship determines the behavior of the electronic lumped, photonic distributed, and metatronic lumped grid based algorithms accuracy when solving PDEs. A lumped circuit node directs current, or displacement current density based on the direc-tion and magnitude that the node’s neighborhood is directing their current or displacement current density. In the case of a lumped circuit the neighborhood of nodes is the entire circuit. In a distributed circuit each nodes neighborhood is defined as all the nodes within one wavelength of operation. If the distance between two adjacent nodes is greater than one wavelength of operation, as is the case in the current fabricated photonic circuit, then all of the nodes are isolated. An isolated node does not feel the effects of a neighborhood because it has none, and instead must determine a new way to direct its optical intensity. The current practice is to engineer the geometry of the node to direct an equal amount of incoming optical intensity into all of the outgoing waveguides. This equal splitting is fixed in passive silicon. The effects on PDE accuracy of lumped neighborhood based variable splitting versus distributed isolated node fixed splitting begin to reveal themselves as the number of nodes in the circuit increases. Changes in grid size, density, or both point to a trend of increasing accuracy for the lumped element circuits and decreasing accuracy for the isolated node cir-cuits when compared to analytical continuous and digital numerical discrete pde solutions. This Thesis’ findings encompassing the combined advantages of increasing accuracy, preserved reconfigurability, increased repetition rate, and decreased footprint for meta-tronic circuits solving partial differential equations paves the wave for experimental fab-ricated demonstrations to validate this theoretical work.},

	abstract = {Due to the end of Moore’s law and Dennard scaling, we are entering a new era of processors. Computing systems are increasingly facing power and performance challenges due to both device- and circuit-related challenges with resistive and capacitive charging. Non-von Neumann architectures are needed to support future computations through innovative post-Moore’s law architectures. To enable these emerging architectures with high-performance and at ultra-low power, both parallel computation and inter-node communication on-the-chip can be supported using photons. To this end, we introduce ROC, a reconfigurable optical computer that can solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PDE solvers form the basis for many traditional simulation problems in science and engineering that are currently performed on supercomputers. Instead of solving problems iteratively, the proposed engine uses a resistive mesh architecture to solve a PDE in a single iteration (one-shot). Instead of using actual electrical circuits, the physical underlying hardware emulates such structures using a silicon-photonics mesh that splits light into separate pathways, allowing it to add or subtract optical power analogous to programmable resistors. The time to obtain the PDE solution then only depends on the time-of-flight of a photon through the programmed mesh, which can be on the order of 10’s of picoseconds given the millimeter-compact integrated photonic circuit. Numerically validated experimental results show that, over multiple configurations, ROC can achieve several orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art GPUs when speed, power, and size are taken into account. Further, it comes within approximately 90\% precision of current numerical solvers. As such, ROC can be a viable reconfigurable, approximate computer with the potential for more precise results when replacing silicon-photonics building blocks with nanoscale photonic lumped-elements.},

	abstract = {Photonic data routing in optical networks is expected to overcome the limitations of electronic routers with respect to data rate, latency, and energy consumption. However, photonics-based routers suffer from dynamic power consumption, and nonsimultaneous usage of multiple wavelength channels when microrings are deployed and are sizable in footprint. Here, we show a design for the first hybrid photonic-plasmonic, nonblocking, broadband 5 × 5 router based on 3-waveguide silicon photonic-plasmonic 2 × 2 switches. The compactness of the router (footprint {\textless}; 200 μm2) results in a short optical propagation delay (0.4 ps) enabling high data capacity up to 2 Tb/s. The router has an average energy consumption ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 fJ/bit depending on either DWDM or CDWM operation, enabled by the low electrical capacitance of the switch. The total average routing insertion loss of 2.5 dB is supported via an optical mode hybridization deployed inside the 2 × 2 switches, which minimizes the coupling losses between the photonic and plasmonic sections of the router. The router's spectral bandwidth resides in the S, C, and L bands and exceeds 100 nm supporting wavelength division multiplexing applications since no resonance feature is required. Taken together this novel optical router combines multiple design features, all required in next-generation high data-throughput optical networks and computing systems.},

	abstract = {In recent years broad community of researchers has emerged, focusing on the original ambitious goals of the AI ﬁeld – the creation and study of software or hardware systems with general intelligence comparable to, and ultimately perhaps greater than, that of human beings. This paper surveys this diverse community and its progress. Approaches to deﬁning the concept of Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) are reviewed including mathematical formalisms, engineering, and biology inspired perspectives. The spectrum of designs for AGI systems includes systems with symbolic, emergentist, hybrid and universalist characteristics. Metrics for general intelligence are evaluated, with a conclusion that, although metrics for assessing the achievement of human-level AGI may be relatively straightforward (e.g. the Turing Test, or a robot that can graduate from elementary school or university), metrics for assessing partial progress remain more controversial and problematic.},
